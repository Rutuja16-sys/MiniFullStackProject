Attached is a full-stack mini project where 
Next.js and Express.js are used to create an online hardware shopping application.

The backend uses Express to verify user login details and serve a product catalog from a database.

The frontend (Next.js) initially displays a welcome page and allows the user to log in.
After providing appropriate credentials the app takes you to the list of products along with their respective details.

The frontend fetches data via the backend API.
